Its 1920 x 1080 FHD resolution VA panel rotates up to angles as extreme as 178°. The compact screen head is twice as slim as its previous generation and sits within a compact 3-side NearEdgeless frame. The stand\u2019s built-in cable management system keeps wires out of sight and out of mind. This is a good thing, because with HDMI, VGA and Audio Out ports, the ThinkVision can connect to a whole range of mission-critical devices. And because your staff are your most precious asset, ThinkVision has TÜV Rheinland Eye Comfort Certified technology to protect them from eye fatigue.","PId":66205,"details":[{"name":"Brand","value":"Lenovo"},{"name":"Aspect Ratio","value":"16.9"},{"name":"Display Diagonal","value":"23.8\" (60.5cm)"},{"name":"Display Resolution","value":"1920x1080 FullHD"},{"name":"Display Response Time (ms), millisecond","value":"6"},{"name":"Display Brightness (cd/m²)","value":"250"},{"name":"Contrast","value":"3000:1"},{"name":"Panel Type","value":"VA"},{"name":"Backlighting Type","value":"LED"},{"name":"Screen Refresh Rate","value":"60 Hz"},{"name":"Number of Colors","value":"16.7 m"},{"name":"Viewing Angle","value":"178° / 178°"},{"name":"VGI","value":"Yes"},{"name":"HDMI High-sharpness multimedia interface","value":"Yes"},{"name":"3.5 mm Audio Out","value":"Yes"},{"name":"Energy Consumption (W), watt","value":"20"},{"name":"Depth (mm), millimeter","value":"'173.1"},{"name":"Height (mm), millimeter","value":"540.4"},{"name":"Weight (kg), kilogram","value":"'3.2"},{"name":"Width (mm), millimeter","value":"434.5"},{"name":"Model/Part Number","value":"62AEKAT2EU"},{"name":"Color","value":"Black"},{"name":"VESA","value":"100x100"},{"name":"AMD FreeSync Support","value":"Yes"},{"name":"Type","value":"Business/Home"},{"name":"Warranty (months)","value":"37"}],"category":"Monitors"}
